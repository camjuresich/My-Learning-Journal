                <h1>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h1>
                <p>
                    After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer
                    Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get
                    expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet
                    like-minded peers.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <img
                src="/images/feature.png"
                alt="computer on a desk, with code on the screen at sunset."
            />
            <div>
                <h2>How I stay commited to learning</h2>
                <p>
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend
                    hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects
                    using what I learned or work new techniques into existing
                    projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share
                    what I was learning and most things about my journey with the
                    world.
                </p>
                <h2>How I got started</h2>
                <p>
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I
                    would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning
                    session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned
                    but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own
                    words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that
                    posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and
                    stay motivated.
